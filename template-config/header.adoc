// In AsciiDoc, you can define attributes with :name: value.
// You can make your own attributes, which serve as variables.
// However, there is also a list of "butiltin" attributes
// that control the behavior of the processor.
// Ref: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/document-attributes-ref/
// There are two types of builtin attributes: those that can 
// only appear in the document header, and those that can
// appear anywhere.
// A document header is the section of the document before
// the first empty line.
// As such, this this file may have comments, but not empty lines
// because that would end the header. If you wish to override
// any of the options here, do so in `user-config/header.adoc` üôÇ
// There is another way to categorize attributes:
// Those that are intended for Asciidoctor (usually they are platform-
// independent, or for html-only), and those that are for Asciidoctor-Pdf
// This file includes both, separated by `REGION`.
// The attributes are sorted by their 1st appearance in the reference page.
// The comments are the titles of the sections where the attribute appears.
